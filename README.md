# What is DP404 Mod?
This is a mod for the visual novel Sunrider Liberation Day Captain's Edition 3.01 developed by [Love In Space](https://forum.loveinspace.moe/).
It contains several bug fixes of the code and other addings to the game.
You are free to modify, translate and/or expand Sunrider or this mod in any maneer you desire, so long as you don't charge other people's money for any of Sunrider assets.

# What's new in this mod?
- Spanish language was **added** to the game. Neither original English nor Japanese languages were removed.
- Some parts of the graphic user interface were improved for a better playing.
- Gameplay bugs, graphical issues and storyline errors were fixed.

# How to install?
- Install Sunrider Liberation Day Captain's Edition 3.01.
- Copy the mod files into the "game" folder within the Sunrider LibDay main game folder. Overwrite all files when prompted.
- Delete the "game/cache" folder within the Sunrider LibDay main game folder since it may cause some errors.
- Run Sunrider Liberation Day.exe. Check the top left corner of the main menu screen. If 'DP404 Mod' text appears, then you're good to go.

This mod works correctly whether or not you have the decensor patch installed.
**Warning:** This mod tampers with several parts of the original game code in order to work properly. Compatibility with other mods is highly unlikely.
